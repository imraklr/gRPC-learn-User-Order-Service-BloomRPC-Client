# Sample project to learn gRPC in Java applications ( A first step to building Java Microservices using gRPC calls )

To run the application, run the main method of both the servers - `UerServer` as well as `OrderServer`.

Test this in **BloomRPC** application by importing the **.proto** files and putting `id` as `5` and `username` as `chandler` for the respective ports mentioned in the project files: `UserServer` and `OrderServer` within the `startServer` method.
